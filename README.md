working on a website to learn coding.  i was recommended to start with a git repo, so here i am
i am now learning to get better with html aswell. i dont know much but ive added a few bits to it.
im so excited to get this project going. i am so very thankful to have the opportunity to do this because i have never been able
to before simply because i had no clue how or where to start. i am very thankful for my friends hintss and jercos for allowing me to be 
able to do this. thank you so very much!

 i also would like to thank xiruus for helping me.
